            <p>The housing system will be instanced, which means players will zone out into an area designated for player houses. There will be one housing area for each of the three city states of Gridania, Limsa Lominsa (Mist) and Ul'dah and once any of these instances are filled a new instance will open up. This means there is no limit on how many plots of land are in the system.

                Housing will cost a lot of gil. It has been said that in order to buy a medium sized plot of land you will need to spend the equivalent of levelling a class to 50 on quests three times and put all the gil you earned into your house. Large plots will be insanely expensive and there will only be 3 such plots per instance. It may be better to start small and work your way up. But there is a twist. Land prices will fall over time if the plot has not been bought up. So it is effectively a good gil sink, the rich will buy early and high while the less well off will wait until the prices are more in line with their savings.

                Two types of housing will be available. These are free company housing as well as individual housing, however free company housing will make it into the game first. These are essentially the same thing, except that with free company housing any bonuses (more on this later) will be available to everyone within the free company. There will also be a shared item safe within free company housing. Free companies can increase in rank and this will bring more housing features to them over time.</p>

                <h3>Mounts and Barding</h3>
                <p>Mounts allow players to travel around Eorzea faster. After acquiring a mount, you can ride it by dragging the icon onto your action bar. Players can acquire their first mount, Company Chocobo, by playing through the main story and joining a Grand Company at around level 20. Other mounts can be acquired by completing different requirements.<br>The chocobo is the primary mount in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. The quest for it is unlocked through the story at level 20. Players can then join a Grand Company and begin the chocobo quest, My Little Chocobo.</p>

                <h3>Jobs and Classes</h3>
                <p>Jobs have specialized abilities aimed to perform specific roles in a group setting. Jobs are the same level as their corresponding classes and can be thought of as specialized modes of the base classes. There are 8 jobs in A Realm Reborn: Warrior, Paladin, Monk, Dragoon, Bard, White Mage, Black Mage, Summoner and Scholar. Players can unlock jobs by having one of the corresponding classes to level 30 and another class to level 15.</p>

                <h3>Artifact Armour</h3>
                <p>The Artifact equipment for any given job comes in five pieces - head, body, hands, legs and feet - and one other piece that varies with the job. The first quest usually rewards a Level 41 weapon and is accessible at Level 40. The next two quests are available at Level 50 and each yield one more piece in the set. The remaining three pieces are involved in the "Borghertz's Hands" line of quests, requiring adventurers to seek out Treasure Coffers in various Rise of the Zilart dungeon areas.</p>
